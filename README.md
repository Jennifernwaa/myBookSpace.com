# myBookSpace
myBookSpace is a personalized, AI-integrated web app for book lovers. Users can log and track their reads, get intelligent book recommendations, and connect with fellow readers through community features like friends and activity feeds. I made this project because me and my friends love reading books, and I figured, why not make a website where we could keep track of the books we're reading and share our thoughts with each other. The name "myBookSpace" was inspired by "myspace".
